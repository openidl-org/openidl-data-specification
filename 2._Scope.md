# Scope

[Include a detailed description of this Working Group’s Scope.  This Scope is important is it establishes the bounds of each contributor's and licensee's patent commitment. For guidance on drafting an appropriate Scope, you may find [ISO's guidance (see page 5)](https://www.iso.org/files/live/sites/isoorg/files/developing_standards/docs/en/how-to-write-standards.pdf "ISO How To Write Standards Guide") helpful.]

This document outlines the scope of work undertaken by the OpenIDS Data Specifications Working Group.

Objectives
The objective of this Working Group is to document the existing de facto standard as the initial OpenIDS Data Specification and put the specification on a standards track. Once the work on defining the initial specification is sufficiently far along, the Working Group will develop additional versions of the specification evolving from the initial specification.

# Background/Context
The open Insurance Data Link (openIDL) is a Linux Foundation project advancing the open Insurance Data Standards (openIDS) initiative. Through open governance and collaboration, openIDL brings carriers, regulators, and technology partners together to define and publish industry-wide data standards. These standards form a common language for insurance data, enabling consistent regulatory reporting, greater transparency, and a foundation for innovation. By aligning the industry around open-source principles, openIDL is building a sustainable framework of dynamic, extensible standards that will evolve with the needs of the entire industry ecosystem.

openIDS, an initiative under openIDL, is designed to improve regulatory reporting, streamline data exchange, and accelerate innovation. openIDS provides a common framework that enables insurers, regulators, and partners to share information efficiently and securely.

By standardizing how policies and insurable objects are described and recorded, openIDS is enabling:

Improved risk assessment – Consistent data means more accurate underwriting.
Regulatory readiness – Recognized data formats enable quicker responses to regulators.
Seamless interoperability – Shared definitions reduce the need for costly one-off data translations.
Better insights – Rich, structured data unlocks more powerful analytics and product innovation.
